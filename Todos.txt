#- When Project gets deleted and is still loaded, it gets saved in the deleted project, not as new project. Maybe the frontend should check and load a new project!?
#- There is a mixup between collab Project id and current project id stored as projectID in redux. Possible solution. Always store project id as projectid and save collabid somewhere else. when commited, a new projectid should be sent. as well
#- when a project title gets changed. it should only change if the loaded project is the changed title project
- There is something wrong with duplicating a project. maybe we should do this in the collaboration-manager-modal?
- drag payload error on tablet (no dragging possible)
