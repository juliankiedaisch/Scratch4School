# `npm version 1.2.3` does the following:
# 1. Update `/package.json` and `/package-lock.json` with the new version
# 2. `git add package.json package-lock.json`
# 3. `git commit -m 1.2.3`
# 4. `git --no-replace-objects tag -m 1.2.3 v1.2.3`

# `npm --workspaces version 1.2.3` changes step 1 to update the version of each workspace but NOT the root.
# The other steps are executed as-is: step 2 will say there's nothing to commit and the process will stop.
# The version numbers in `/packages/*/package.json` will be updated but not committed.

# `npm --workspaces --include-workspace-root version 1.2.3` changes step 1 to update the version of each workspace AND
# the root. However, the remaining steps are still unaltered. You'll end up with a commit that only updates the
# workspace root, and the version numbers in `/packages/*/package.json` will be updated but not committed.

# Fortunately, npm runs the `version` script as part of this process. Unfortunately, the script runs after
# `/package.json` and `/package-lock.json` are updated, but before `/packages/*/package.json` are updated. That
# means the `--workspaces` flag isn't helping, and we need to update workspace versions ourselves. We can do that with
# `npm --workspaces version --no-git-tag-version ${npm_package_version}` and then stage the files.

# (Props to this post: <https://blog.chlod.net/technical/easy-npm-version-synchronization-for-monorepos/>)

# BUT WAIT!

# What about `--no-git-tag-version`? The normal behavior for `npm version` in that case is to adjust version numbers
# but not stage or commit anything. If this script stages `/packages/*/package.json` in that case, that's no good.

# The only way I've found to detect `--no-git-tag-version` is to check for the existence of an environment variable
# called `npm_config_git_tag_version`. Unfortunately, it's considered "true" when the value is an empty string, so we
# need to check for that as well. Big thanks to this StackOverflow answer: <https://serverfault.com/a/382740>
# TL;DR: `[ -z "${npm_config_git_tag_version+set}" ]` is test we want.

# So, the plan is:
# 1. The user should run `npm version 1.2.3`
# 2. npm will update `/package.json` and `/package-lock.json` for the workspace root
# 3. npm will run this script (it should be set as the `version` script in `/package.json`)
# 4. This script will stage `/packages/*/package.json` if `npm_config_git_tag_version` exists
# 5. npm will choose whether to commit / tag afterward on its own
